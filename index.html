                <p>
                    I'm a software engineer specializing in backend server programming, realtime communication, and scaling video based systems.
                    Over my career I've worked from early seed stage start ups all the way through to larger companies.

                <p>
                    Currently I am working at <a href="https://grain.co">Grain</a> where I have been engineering since it was a preseed company to its current round.
                    I work heavily in Elixir/Phoenix, GraphQL, video encoding, and Terraform and continue to experiment in new ways to bring creative products to the market.

                <p>
                    With most of my time consumed with running my day job, I have not spent much time in a while on projects and I don't feel they represent my actual engineering output.
                    However feel free to browse a random selection of ones.
