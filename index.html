                <p>
                    I'm a software engineer specializing in backend server programming, realtime communication, and scaling video based systems.
                    Over my career I've worked from early seed stage start ups all the way through to larger companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I am working at <a href="https://grain.co">Grain</a> where I have been one of the main engineers architecting and
                    programming the backend, infrastructure, and video processing from the product's conception to an application used by thousands
                    of people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work heavily in Elixir/Phoenix, GraphQL, video encoding, and Terraform and continue to experiment in new ways to bring
                    creative products to the market.
