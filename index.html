                <p>
                    I'm a software engineer specializing in backend server programming, realtime communication, and scaling video based systems.
                    Over my career I've worked from early seed stage start ups all the way through to larger companies.

                <p>
                    Currently I am working at <a href="https://grain.co">Grain</a> where I have been engineering since it was a preseed company to its current round.
                    I work heavily in Elixir/Phoenix, GraphQL, video encoding, and Terraform and continue to experiment in new ways to bring creative products to the market.
